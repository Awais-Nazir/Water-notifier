                          # Water-notifier
I created a Program that notifies you after a specific time to Drink Water, Time is Customizable, I used Win10Toast Library of Python to do so.
In this Program, You can customize the Title and the description of the message, you can specify the time after 
which the notification appears
currently I have applied 900 seconds means 15 min. you can set time in seconds.
time can be specified in the last line of the code 
time.sleep(<time in seconds>)

At the end if you want the program continuously running in the background.
you can follow the steps:
1- Press and hold Shift Key and Right Click the Mouse.
2- there will be an option of "Open PowerShell windows here".click on that
3- run the following command: pythonw.exe main2.py
4- main2.py is the name of the Python file

If you want to end the file running in the background, you can go to the Task Manager anger and d find the Python file running in 
background processes and end that task by right-clicking this.

Hope you find it helpful, if you facing any issues or have any queries, let me know.
Thanks
